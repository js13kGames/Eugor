So you killed the boss but can you make it back from the dungeon?

An very simple [Roguelike][roguelike] with reversed perspective (side
instead of top down) that starts from the end of the game right after
you defeated the last boss deep down in the dungeon.

A game for [js13kGames][js13kgames] 2015. The theme was "Reversed".

Play it [here][play].
